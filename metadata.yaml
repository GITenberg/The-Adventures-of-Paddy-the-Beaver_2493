description: Everyone is curious! Farmer Brown's boy cannot figure it out. Then Peter
  Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat set their minds to the problem and try to wrestle it to
  the ground. What is happening in the peaceful meadow where the stream flowed so
  quietly before--and what does Paddy Beaver have to do with it?
